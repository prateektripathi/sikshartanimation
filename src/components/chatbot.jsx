        <p>
          Cognitive Intelligence is within reach.
          Building a unified cognitive intelligence layer for India is one of the
          most important technical problems of our era.
          <br /><br />

          We have started the country’s first straight-shot Cognitive Systems Lab,
          with one goal and one product: an intelligence engine that can understand
          how humans learn, think, and build — and upgrade it.
          <br /><br />

          It’s called Sikksha AI. Cognitive intelligence is our mission, our name,
          and our entire product roadmap, because it is our sole focus.
          <br /><br />

          Our team, partners, and research model are aligned around a single idea:
          <br />
          <strong>&gt; India cannot leap into an AI-first world without rebuilding
          the way humans learn.</strong>
          <br /><br />

          We approach cognition, capability, and behaviour as engineering
          challenges — problems solvable through breakthroughs in AI, simulation,
          reasoning architectures, and cognitive science.
          <br /><br />

          We advance capabilities rapidly while ensuring precision, safety, and
          rigour remain ahead. That is how we scale with clarity instead of chaos.
          <br /><br />

          Our singular focus means no distractions from generic EdTech cycles,
          commercial shortcuts, or outdated academic structures.
          <br /><br />

          Our research model ensures depth, stability, and long-term progress —
          insulated from short-term noise.
          <br /><br />

          We are an Indian deep-tech research company with roots across Lucknow,
          Bengaluru, and emerging partnerships with global cognitive labs.
          <br /><br />

          This gives us access to young talent, rigorous researchers, and the rare
          ability to build frontier-grade intelligence systems inside India.
          <br /><br />

          We are assembling a lean, obsessed team of Data Science engineers,
          cognitive scientists, ML researchers, psychologists, and simulation
          architects dedicated to one problem and one problem only:
          <br />
          <strong>&gt; Rebuilding the cognitive engine of a nation.</strong>
          <br /><br />

          If that is the challenge you’ve been waiting for, we offer the opportunity
          to do your life’s most meaningful work — and to help solve one of the
          defining technical problems of this century.
          <br /><br />

          Now is the moment. Join us.
